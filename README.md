# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project uses machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

## Project Overview
- Preprocessed and scaled features for balanced model input.
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier to detect fraud.
- Evaluated model performance using:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Feature Importance
  - ROC Curve & AUC Score
- Performed cross-validation for robust performance estimation.

## Modules Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
Due to size limitations, the dataset is not included in this repository but can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
